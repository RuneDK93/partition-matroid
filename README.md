# partition-matroid
A Sage based class for creating partition matroids with tuneable capacities.

## Partition Matroid

Here the ground set $E$ is partitioned into disjoint sets $E_1,E_2...E_l$ and an independent set $X$ must follow:

$ |X \cap E_i| \le k_i $ for all $i = 1,...,l$

$\le$ $\cap$

So the size of the intersection of the independent set with each partition $E_i$ must be at max $k_i$.
